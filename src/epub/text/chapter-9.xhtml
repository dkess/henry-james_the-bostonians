			<p>Ransom approached <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder again, who had remained on her sofa with Olive Chancellor; and as she turned her face to him he saw that she had felt the universal contagion. Her keen eye sparkled, there was a flush on her matronly cheek, and she had evidently made up her mind what line to take. Olive Chancellor sat motionless; her eyes were fixed on the floor with the rigid, alarmed expression of her moments of nervous diffidence; she gave no sign of observing her kinsman’s approach. He said something to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder, something that imperfectly represented his admiration of Verena; and this lady replied with dignity that it was no wonder the girl spoke so well⁠—she spoke in such a good cause. “She is very graceful, has a fine command of language; her father says it’s a natural gift.” Ransom saw that he should not in the least discover <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder’s real opinion, and her dissimulation added to his impression that she was a woman with a policy. It was none of his business whether in her heart she thought Verena a parrot or a genius; it was perceptible to him that she saw she would be effective, would help the cause. He stood almost appalled for a moment, as he said to himself that she would take her up and the girl would be ruined, would force her note and become a screamer. But he quickly dodged this vision, taking refuge in a mechanical appeal to his cousin, of whom he inquired how she liked Miss Verena. Olive made no answer; her head remained averted, she bored the carpet with her conscious eyes. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder glanced at her askance, and then said to Ransom serenely:</p>
			<p>“You praise the grace of your Southern ladies, but you have had to come North to see a human gazelle. Miss Tarrant is of the best New England stock⁠—what <em>I</em> call the best!”</p>
			<p>“I’m sure from what I have seen of the Boston ladies, no manifestation of grace can excite my surprise,” Ransom rejoined, looking, with his smile, at his cousin.</p>
			<p>“She has been powerfully affected,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder explained, very slightly dropping her voice, as Olive, apparently, still remained deaf.</p>
			<p>Miss Birdseye drew near at this moment; she wanted to know if <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder didn’t want to express some acknowledgment, on the part of the company at large, for the real stimulus Miss Tarrant had given them. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder said: Oh yes, she would speak now with pleasure; only she must have a glass of water first. Miss Birdseye replied that there was some coming in a moment; one of the ladies had asked for it, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pardon had just stepped down to draw some. Basil took advantage of this intermission to ask Miss Birdseye if she would give him the great privilege of an introduction to Miss Verena. “<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder will thank her for the company,” he said, laughing, “but she won’t thank her for me.”</p>
			<p>Miss Birdseye manifested the greatest disposition to oblige him; she was so glad he had been impressed. She was proceeding to lead him toward Miss Tarrant when Olive Chancellor rose abruptly from her chair and laid her hand, with an arresting movement, on the arm of her hostess. She explained to her that she must go, that she was not very well, that her carriage was there; also that she hoped Miss Birdseye, if it was not asking too much, would accompany her to the door.</p>
			<p>“Well, you are impressed too,” said Miss Birdseye, looking at her philosophically. “It seems as if no one had escaped.”</p>
			<p>Ransom was disappointed; he saw he was going to be taken away, and, before he could suppress it, an exclamation burst from his lips⁠—the first exclamation he could think of that would perhaps check his cousin’s retreat: “Ah, Miss Olive, are you going to give up <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder?”</p>
			<p>At this Miss Olive looked at him, showed him an extraordinary face, a face he scarcely understood or even recognised. It was portentously grave, the eyes were enlarged, there was a red spot in each of the cheeks, and as directed to him, a quick, piercing question, a kind of leaping challenge, in the whole expression. He could only answer this sudden gleam with a stare, and wonder afresh what trick his Northern kinswoman was destined to play him. Impressed too? He should think he had been! <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder, who was decidedly a woman of the world, came to his assistance, or to Miss Chancellor’s, and said she hoped very much Olive wouldn’t stay⁠—she felt these things too much. “If you stay, I won’t speak,” she added; “I should upset you altogether.” And then she continued, tenderly, for so preponderantly intellectual a nature: “When women feel as you do, how can I doubt that we shall come out all right?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, we shall come out all right, I guess,” murmured Miss Birdseye.</p>
			<p>“But you must remember Beacon Street,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Farrinder subjoined. “You must take advantage of your position⁠—you must wake up the Back Bay!”</p>
			<p>“I’m sick of the Back Bay!” said Olive fiercely; and she passed to the door with Miss Birdseye, bidding goodbye to no one. She was so agitated that, evidently, she could not trust herself, and there was nothing for Ransom but to follow. At the door of the room, however, he was checked by a sudden pause on the part of the two ladies: Olive stopped and stood there hesitating. She looked round the room and spied out Verena, where she sat with her mother, the centre of a gratified group; then, throwing back her head with an air of decision, she crossed over to her. Ransom said to himself that now, perhaps, was his chance, and he quickly accompanied Miss Chancellor. The little knot of reformers watched her as she arrived; their faces expressed a suspicion of her social importance, mingled with conscientious scruples as to whether it were right to recognise it. Verena Tarrant saw that she was the object of this manifestation, and she got up to meet the lady whose approach was so full of point. Ransom perceived, however, or thought he perceived, that she recognised nothing; she had no suspicions of social importance. Yet she smiled with all her radiance, as she looked from Miss Chancellor to him; smiled because she liked to smile, to please, to feel her success⁠—or was it because she was a perfect little actress, and this was part of her training? She took the hand that Olive put out to her; the others, rather solemnly, sat looking up from their chairs.</p>
			<p>“You don’t know me, but I want to know you,” Olive said. “I can thank you now. Will you come and see me?”</p>
			<p>“Oh yes; where do you live?” Verena answered, in the tone of a girl for whom an invitation (she hadn’t so many) was always an invitation.</p>
			<p>Miss Chancellor syllabled her address, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tarrant came forward, smiling. “I know about you, Miss Chancellor. I guess your father knew my father⁠—<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenstreet. Verena will be very glad to visit you. We shall be very happy to see you in <em>our</em> home.”</p>
			<p>Basil Ransom, while the mother spoke, wanted to say something to the daughter, who stood there so near him, but he could think of nothing that would do; certain words that came to him, his Mississippi phrases, seemed patronising and ponderous. Besides, he didn’t wish to assent to what she had said; he wished simply to tell her she was delightful, and it was difficult to mark that difference. So he only smiled at her in silence, and she smiled back at him⁠—a smile that seemed to him quite for himself.</p>
			<p>“Where do you live?” Olive asked; and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tarrant replied that they lived at Cambridge, and that the horsecars passed just near their door. Whereupon Olive insisted “Will you come very soon?” and Verena said, Oh yes, she would come very soon, and repeated the number in Charles Street, to show that she had taken heed of it. This was done with childlike good faith. Ransom saw that she would come and see anyone who would ask her like that, and he regretted for a minute that he was not a Boston lady, so that he might extend to her such an invitation. Olive Chancellor held her hand a moment longer, looked at her in farewell, and then, saying, “Come, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ransom,” drew him out of the room. In the hall they met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pardon, coming up from the lower regions with a jug of water and a tumbler. Miss Chancellor’s hackney-coach was there, and when Basil had put her into it she said to him that she wouldn’t trouble him to drive with her⁠—his hotel was not near Charles Street. He had so little desire to sit by her side⁠—he wanted to smoke⁠—that it was only after the vehicle had rolled off that he reflected upon her coolness, and asked himself why the deuce she had brought him away. She <em>was</em> a very odd cousin, was this Boston cousin of his. He stood there a moment, looking at the light in Miss Birdseye’s windows and greatly minded to re-enter the house, now he might speak to the girl. But he contented himself with the memory of her smile, and turned away with a sense of relief, after all, at having got out of such wild company, as well as with (in a different order) a vulgar consciousness of being very thirsty.</p>
